\begin{abstract}
Fuzzers are often guided by coverage, making the estimation of maximum 
achievable coverage a key concern in fuzzing.
However, achieving 100\% coverage is infeasible for most real-world
software systems, regardless of effort.
While static reachability analysis can provide an upper bound,
it is often highly inaccurate.
Recently, statistical estimation methods based on species richness
estimators from biostatistics have been proposed as a potential solution.
Yet, the lack of reliable benchmarks with labeled ground truth has
limited rigorous evaluation of their accuracy.

To address this challenge, we propose an evaluation framework that
synthetically generates large programs with complex control flows,
ensuring well-defined reachability and providing ground truth for evaluation.
Additionally, we propose a novel reliability check for these estimators
on real-world benchmarks without labeled ground truthâ€”by varying the size
of sampling units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate.

Our work aims to identify the most reliable methods for estimating
maximum achievable coverage in practical fuzzing campaigns.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

Fuzzing is an automated testing technique that leverages guidance provided
by coverage~\cite{boehme2016coverage}.
The budget allocated to fuzzing, and hence, the stopping criteria
of fuzzing is strongly determined by the maximum possible coverage that can
be obtained~\cite{fell2017review}.
%
However, achieving 100\% coverage in complex real-world programs is practically impossible~\cite{horgan1994achieving}. 
As the input domain and execution space grow, exhaustive testing becomes infeasible~\cite{knight1996exhaustive}.

Yet, quantifying the maximum reachable coverage (also called \emph{maximum reachability}) remains a challenge, raising a fundamental question:
\emph{How close is a fuzzing campaign to its maximum reachable coverage?}


Recent researches have proposed \emph{species richness estimators} from
biostatistics~\cite{chao2016species} as a principled approach to estimate
the reachable coverage of a fuzzing campaign~\cite{boehme2018stads}.
These estimators model fuzzing as a statistical sampling process where
each test input exercises one or more program behaviors---such as reaching
a program element---which can then be used to estimate the total number of such behaviors~\cite{boehme2018stads}.


However, evaluating the accuracy and reliability
of these estimators is difficult. The main issue is that, to evaluate such
estimators, we need a benchmark of several large complex programs where
maximum reachability is known. Unfortunately, establishing the maximum
reachability is impossible except for trivial programs. Hence, researchers have resorted to using small programs, fuzzed to saturation as an alternative~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}.
This approach is not ideal as performance of an estimator in small
programs may not be representative of the performance of an estimator in complex
real-world programs.

We propose an alternative approach to overcome this difficulty. We note that
in programs such as parsers (which are one of the major subjects for fuzzing)
the control-flow of a program along with its data-flow determines the
complexity of the program, and hence, determines the difficulty
experienced in reaching the program elements. The control-flow of any
structured program can be represented as a context-free
grammar~(see for e.g., \Cref{fig:cfg}).

We note that it is possible to generate arbitrary
context-free grammars. Furthermore, one can also fine-tune the complexity
of such grammars generated based on several dimensions such as the size
of the grammar, the number of direct and indirect recursions allowed, the
number of linear-recursive rules etc.
Finally, converting a context-free grammar to recursive descent
parsers is well known, and produces parsers which have similarly complex
control-flows.

Our proposal is then to leverage such arbitrarily generated complex
context-free grammars into parsers, and use such parsers as benchmarks for
estimating the reliability of reachability estimators. We propose to compare
the difficulty of fuzzers when faced with real-world parsers to these
generated parsers to ensure that the generated benchmarks are similar to
real-world programs in complexity. If they prove equivalent in complexity,
such generated, and ever-renewable benchmarks may not only be suitable for
evaluating the reliability of estimators, but also for other evaluation
tasks that require complex programs such as evaluating fuzzers,
fault localization techniques, program repair techniques, and so on.

While synthetic benchmarks are a useful alternative, is it possible to use
real-world programs even if ground-truth (the maximum reachability) is not
known? A recent research on evaluating the reliability of biostatistics based
estimators for mutation analysis~\cite{Kuznetsov2024empirical} provides a
solution. The researchers point out that the \emph{sampling units} used in
species richness estimators should not have a significant effect on the final
estimate. In previous research on coverage estimation~\cite{liyanage2023reachable},
the sampling-unit used is the time interval. That is, the incidence data of
each 15-minutes bin was used as the sampling unit. Since the 15-minute interval
is arbitrary, it stands to reason that changing the timing granularity should
not impact the final estimate. Hence, we propose to evaluate the reliability of
maximum coverage estimators under varying granularity of sampling interval,
for the same fuzzing campaign duration.

% To be considered reliable, an estimator should yield consistent point estimates of maximum reachability across different sampling unit definitions, provided the total campaign length is held constant.

% Hence, in this paper, we propose to systematically investigate the reliability
% of incidence-based statistical estimators for maximum coverage.

\noindent{}\textbf{Contributions.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Synthetic benchmarks for evaluation:} We propose a novel
framework to generate synthetic program benchmarks that emulates real-world
programs, and use this to evaluate maximum reachability estimators.

  \item \textbf{Sampling-unit based evaluation of reliability:} We will evaluate
    the reliability of maximum reachability estimators on 32 real-world programs
    by comparing the estimates under sampling units of diverse granularity.

\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} introduces the statistical reachability estimation and evaluation in fuzzing. Section~\ref{sec:method} presents our methodology for assessing the accuracy and reliability of statistical estimators of maximum reachability. Section~\ref{sec:setup} details the experimental setup used to evaluate our approach. Then, Section~\ref{sec:related} and Section~\ref{sec:threats} discuss the associated related work and threats to validity. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and outlines directions for future research.

%\section{Reachability Estimation in Fuzzing} 
\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:model}
In this section, we first explain the theoretical underpinnings of the reachability estimation models. 
Next, we introduce the context-free grammar, and explain
the control-flow graphs.
\subsection{Probabilistic Model for Fuzzing}
The STADS\footnote{STADSâ€”Software Testing As Discovery of Species} framework~\cite{boehme2018stads,boehme2021residual,nguyen2022bedivfuzz,boehme2020boosting} formalizes
fuzzing as a statistical sampling process $\mathcal{F}$. Each test input is drawn with replacement from the program's input space $\pmb{\mathcal{D}}$. Assuming a sequence of $N$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables are drawn, we formally define the fuzzing campaign $\mathcal{F}$ as:

\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{F}=\{X_n \mid X_n \in \pmb{\mathcal{D}}\}_{n=1}^N
\end{equation*}

The input space $\pmb{\mathcal{D}}$ consists of $S$ (potentially overlapping) subdomains $\{\mathcal{D}_i\}_{i=1}^S$, each representing a distinct \emph{coverage element}. An input $X_n \in \mathcal{F}$ is said to discover a \emph{new} coverage element $\mathcal{D}_i$ if $X_n \in \mathcal{D}_i$ and no earlier input $X_m \in \mathcal{F}$ for $m < n$ has been drawn from $\mathcal{D}_i$â€”that is, $\mathcal{D}_i$ is being encountered for the first time.


\subsection{Bernoulli Product Model}
Since each input in $\mathcal{F}$ may belong to one or more coverage elements, the STADS model represents coverage using \emph{sampling-unit-based incidence data}~\cite{colwell2012models,chao2017thirty}, where a sampling unit aggregates all inputs generated within a fixed time interval. The underlying probabilistic model for this representation is the \emph{Bernoulli product model}. Grouping inputs into sampling units is essential to reduce the overhead of tracking fine-grained coverage information for each individual input during fuzzing.

%This approach eliminates the need to record data for every individual test input in a fuzzing process that generates thousands of inputs per second. Instead, multiple inputs can be grouped into a \emph{sampling unit}.

For each sampling unit, the collected data indicates whether a coverage element
has been reached. Let $\pi_i$ denote the probability that a sampling unit covers
element $\mathcal{D}_i$, assuming $\pi_i$ remains constant across all randomly
selected sampling units.
In general, the sum of all $\pi_i$ values does \emph{not} equal unity.

During a fuzzing campaign, suppose we record $t$ sampling units. The incidence data forms an element$\times$sampling-unit incidence matrix ${W_{ij};i=1,2,\dots,S,j=1,2,\dots,t}$ with $S$ rows and $t$ columns, where $W_{ij} = 1$ if element $i$ is covered in sampling unit $j$, and $W_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

The incidence frequency $Y_i$ represents the number of sampling units in which element $\mathcal{D}_i$ is covered; i.e., $Y_i=\sum_{j=1}^{t}W_{ij}$. A coverage element $\mathcal{D}_i$ that has not been covered by any sampling unit will have an incidence frequency of zero; i.e., $Y_i=0$.

Given the set of detection probabilities $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\dots,\pi_S)$, we assume each element $W_{ij}$ in the incidence matrix follows a Bernoulli distribution with probability $\pi_i$. The probability distribution for the incidence matrix is:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        P(W_{ij}=w_{ij};i=1,2,\dots,S,j=1,2,\dots,t) \\
        = \prod_{j=1}^{t}\prod_{i=1}^{S}\pi_i^{w_{ij}}(1-\pi_i)^{1-w_{ij}} \\
        = \prod_{i=1}^{S}\pi_i^{y_i}(1-\pi_i)^{t-y_i}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The marginal distribution for the incidence-based frequency $Y_i$ for the $i$-th coverage element follows a binomial distribution characterized by $t$ and the detection probability $\pi_i$:

\begin{equation}
    P(Y_i=y_i) = \binom{t}{y_i}\pi_i^{y_i}(1-\pi_i)^{t-y_i}, \qquad i=1,2,\dots,S.
\end{equation}

Denote the incidence frequency counts by $(f_0, f_1, \dots, f_t)$, where $f_k$ is the number of elements covered in exactly $k$ sampling units in the data, $k=0,1,\dots,t$. Here, $f_1$ represents the number of \emph{singleton} elements (those that are covered in only one sampling unit), and $f_2$ represents the number of \emph{doubleton} elements (those that are covered in exactly two sampling units). The unobservable zero frequency count $f_0$ denotes the number of coverage elements that are not covered by any of the $t$ sampling units. Then, the number of covered elements in the current campaign is $S(t)=\sum_{i>0}f_i$, and $S(t)+f_0=S$.

%During a fuzzing campaign where we generate enormous amount of test inputs per unit time (at least thousands of inputs within seconds), it is not quite not practical to save the outcome for each input (i.e. the species $\mathcal{D}_i$ that our $X_n$ belongs to) in our data storage. Yet, it is a common practice to write such data at regular intervals. For instance, in our experimentation of 7-day fuzzing campaigns, we record incidence data once in every 15 minutes. Statistically, we can consider all the inputs generated between two consecutive recording instances as a sample of inputs and we indicate the detection/non-detection of species in this sample as a record. 
%

%Below we explain the probabilistic model for our fuzzing data. 
%
%\subsection{Probabilistic Model for Sampling-Unit-Based Data} \label{sec:probmodel}
%
%Assuming that the fuzzer's search space contains $S$ species, indexed by ${1,2,\dots,S}$. Without loss of generality, assume we have sampled $t$ sampling units, indexed by $1,2,\dots,t$, where each sampling unit represents a set of test inputs generated during a certain period of the ongoing fuzzing campaign. A species could be any choice of a program behaviour such as bugs or coverage elements like program paths, branches, or functions. It is assumed that these sampling units are randomly and independently sampled.

\subsection{Estimators of Fuzzer Effectiveness and Ground Truth}
\label{sec:reachability}

\noindent\textbf{Estimators ($\hat{S}$):} We build on prior work by continuing to use all state-of-the-art bio-statistical estimators for fuzzing effectiveness under the Bernoulli product model, as established in~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}. Additionally, inspired by recent studies on estimator performance for killable mutant estimation~\cite{Kuznetsov2024empirical}, we incorporate further estimatorsâ€”including \emph{bootstrap}~\cite{smith1984nonparametric}, \emph{Zelterman}~\cite{bohning2010some}, and others previously unused in fuzzingâ€”within our modeling framework.
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent\textbf{Ground Truth ($S$):} A key challenge in evaluating estimators of fuzzing effectiveness is the absence of an absolute ground truth. Existing strategies for approximating ground truth in fuzzing evaluation each have inherent limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{\textbf{Plateaued Coverage~\cite{boehme2018stads}:}} It was common practice to treat the observed coverage at the end of a fuzzing campaign as ground truth, particularly when the coverage curve plateaued and showed no further growth. However, this stability may be illusory, as new behaviors can still emerge given more time~\cite{dijkstra2002ewd,boehme2021residual}.
    
    \item \emph{\textbf{Small-scale Programs~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}:}} For programs with limited behavioral diversity, fuzzers often reach coverage saturation quickly, making them suitable for ground truth benchmarking. Yet, they poorly reflect the behavioral complexity of real-world programs, where highly skewed behavior distributionsâ€”akin to ecological settings with few common and many rare speciesâ€”can cause overestimation of estimator accuracy.
    
    \item \emph{\textbf{Bootstrapping~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}:}} Once coverage stabilizes, bootstrapping/resampling from obtained campaign data enables statistical approximation of ground truth. This relies on the assumption that the empirical distribution closely mirrors the underlying behavior spaceâ€”an assumption that breaks down when regions that could deviate this distribution remain unreached or input generation is biased.
\end{enumerate}



%With the introduction of the STADS statistical framework and the growing adoption of fuzzing, understanding a fuzzer's detection capacity has become increasingly important. As a result, statistical techniques for estimating maximum reachability $\hat{S}$ have gained prominence \cite{boehme2018stads,liyanage2023reachable,boehme2019assurances}. Most estimators of $\hat{S}$ that conform to the probabilistic model in \autoref{sec:model} are introduced to fuzzing from the well-established field of ecological bio-statistics. However, challenges affecting the accuracy and precision of these estimates have been discussed both in the original STADS framework \cite{boehme2018stads} and in more recent evaluations \cite{liyanage2023reachable} of estimator performance. We discuss two critical challenges in more detail that we believe have a significant impact on reachability estimation and its evaluation in fuzzing.

%\subsection{Adaptive bias}
%A key statistical challenge in greybox fuzzing is \emph{adaptive bias}: as coverage-increasing inputs are added as new seeds, the distribution $\pi_i$ for $i: 1 \leq i \leq S$ evolves throughout the fuzzing campaign \cite{liyanage2021security}. A fundamental assumption of the Bernoulli Product modelâ€”common in statistics and machine learningâ€”is that samples are independent and identically distributed (\emph{iid}), meaning the distribution of detection probabilities remains unchanged over time.  

%This assumption holds in blackbox fuzzing campaigns where no new seeds are added to the seed corpus while the fuzzer is running. However, in greybox fuzzing, which is the predominant fuzzing technique today, the outcome of one sample influences subsequent samples, violating the independence assumption \cite{boehme2020boosting,boehme2018stads,liyanage2021security}. Consequently, applying existing statistical estimators to greybox fuzzing leads to \emph{adaptive bias}, where estimates systematically over- or under-estimate the true value in greybox campaigns.

%Therefore, developing novel estimation strategies that correct adaptive bias in statistical estimation of key performance parameters is crucial for assessing greybox fuzzing progress and predicting its future trajectory. Recent advancements have introduced techniques that mitigate adaptive bias to estimate \emph{residual risk} \cite{boehme2021residual} and to extrapolate \emph{coverage rate} \cite{liyanage2024extrapolating} in greybox fuzzing. However, state-of-the-art reachability estimators continue to be affected by adaptive bias.


%\subsection{Challenge of Establishing Ground Truth for Evaluation}

%As with other software testing techniques, fuzzing aims to progressively explore diverse program behaviorsâ€”such as increasing code coverage or triggering distinct faultsâ€”over time. However, a fundamental challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of a fuzzing campaign lies in the absence of an absolute ground truth. Specifically, we can never be certain that all reachable program behaviors have been exercised, regardless of how long the fuzzer runs \cite{dijkstra2002ewd}. There always exists a non-zero probability that previously undiscovered behaviors may emerge as new test inputs are generated \cite{boehme2021residual}.

%Despite this inherent uncertainty, the effectiveness of a fuzzing approach is often evaluated based on its maximum observed reachability within a fixed time or resource budget. For example, widely used benchmarks such as Fuzzbench \cite{metzman2021fuzzbench} and Magma \cite{hazimeh2020magma} assess fuzzers by measuring the coverage achieved after executing for a predetermined duration (e.g., 24 hours in the case of Fuzzbench). However, such evaluations can be misleading in scenarios where novel program behaviors are discovered beyond the allotted time window. This limitation underscores the need for more conclusive and robust quantitative techniques to assess fuzzing effectivenessâ€”particularly methods grounded in data-driven estimation of maximum reachability. Still, establishing the ground truth remains a cornerstone for reliably evaluating such quantitative reachability measures.

%\subsection{Existing Methods in Approximating Ground-Truth for Maximum Reachability}

%Even though achieving a 100\% guarantee of exhausting all possible program behaviors is inherently unattainable, the longer a fuzzing campaign proceeds without encountering new behaviors, the lower the probability of discovering additional ones becomes. This diminishing discovery rate, in turn, increases our confidence in treating the current state as an empirical approximation of the ground truth for maximum reachability. However, recent empirical evidence based on extensive 7-day AFL++ \cite{fioraldi2020AFL++} fuzzing campaigns across 32 real-world C programs demonstrates that reaching a true asymptote in coverage is often elusive in practice \cite{liyanage2023reachable}. While coverage curves may appear to saturate when plotted on a linear scale, this effect is far less discernible on a logarithmic scaleâ€”suggesting that new behaviors continue to emerge at a slow but non-negligible rate. This observation further complicates the task of defining and approximating ground truth in fuzzing evaluation. Moreover, the same study highlights the limitations of using static analysis for estimating maximum reachable coverage, revealing both under- and over-approximation in practice. 

%To address this challenge, the current fuzzing literature proposes state-of-the-art strategies to approximate ground-truth reachability, particularly for evaluating statistical estimators of maximum reachability:

%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item \textbf{Using small-scale programs as subjects:} When the subject program is relatively small and contains only a limited number of distinct reachable behaviors, fuzzers are more likely to achieve saturation within a feasible time frame. This makes such programs suitable proxies for maximum reachability estimator evaluations with ground-truth.
    
%    \item \textbf{Bootstrapping from campaign data:} After executing a fuzzer for a sufficiently long periodâ€”ideally until the coverage or bug discovery curve exhibits signs of plateauingâ€”bootstrap resampling can be applied to the observed data. The key intuition is that the relationship between the empirical distribution of discovered behaviors and the underlying theoretical population mirrors the relationship between bootstrap samples and the empirical distribution. This method enables statistical approximation of ground-truth reachability without requiring absolute exhaustiveness.
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Drawbacks of Existing Ground-Truth Approaches}

%Despite efforts to approximate ground truth in fuzzing evaluation, existing methods, particularly those relying on small-scale programs, have significant limitations. While small programs enable faster saturation of program behaviors, they fail to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world systems, which often exhibit a highly skewed distribution of behaviorsâ€”similar to ecological environments with a few abundant behaviors and many rare ones. In contrast, smaller programs tend to have a less skewed distribution of species, leading to an overestimation of fuzzing estimatorsâ€™ accuracy. This discrepancy results in misleading conclusions when performance estimators derived from small-scale programs are applied to larger, more complex systems, where the species distribution is less predictable. Consequently, the primary drawback of using small-scale programs for ground-truth approximation is the risk of overstating the effectiveness of fuzzing approaches when applied to real-world software.

%In the case of bootstrapping, the core assumptionâ€”that the empirical distribution obtained from a fuzzing campaign reasonably approximates the true underlying distribution of all possible program behaviorsâ€”fails to satisfy when the campaign has not yet thoroughly explored critical regions of the codebase or when input generation is inherently biased. This assumption further relies on the expectation that the future trajectory of behavior discovery will not significantly deviate from its current trend, implying that species accumulation will smoothly approach saturation. However, without additional quantitative evidence to support the stability of this trajectoryâ€”such as statistical indicators of diminishing returns or convergence metricsâ€”such assumptions remain speculative. In the absence of such validation, bootstrapped estimates may result in substantial over- or under-estimations of maximum reachability, ultimately undermining the reliability of fuzzing effectiveness evaluations.  

%These limitations highlight the need for more robust, scalable, and accurate methods of defining and approximating ground truth in fuzzing evaluation, particularly as programs grow in size and complexity.

\subsection{Control-flow graphs}
We generate large programs with complex control flow by leveraging the structural isomorphism between control-flow graphs and context-free grammars. A control-flow graph represents the possible execution paths of a program and is typically modeled as a directed graph. \Cref{fig:cfg} illustrates example control-flow graphs for three procedures: \<Y>, \<Z>, and \<X>.

Each control-flow graph consists of a set of nodes $N$, where each node $N_i$ represents a program statement\footnote{Traditionally, a node corresponds to a basic block, but for the purposes of this work, we treat each node as a single statement without loss of generality.}. Every graph has a unique entry node $P^s$ and exit node $P^e$, with execution proceeding sequentially within the graph. The edges $E_{i,j}$ define the possible transfers of control from node $N_i$ to node $N_j$. When a node has multiple outgoing edges, these edges are labeled to distinguish between different execution paths. For example, in \Cref{tikz:condition}, node \<C> models a conditional statement with two labeled edges: \<T> (true) and \<F> (false).

Individual procedures have their own control-flow graphs, which are connected to other graphs at their call sites via call edges. These connections are denoted by labeling nodes with the name of the called procedure. For instance, in \Cref{tikz:sequence}, the control-flow graph of procedure \<X> includes nodes \<Y> and \<Z>, which represent calls to the corresponding procedures.

We distinguish four types of edges in a control-flow graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unconditional edges:} Represent sequential execution without branching. For example, all edges in \Cref{tikz:sequence} are unconditional.
\item \textbf{Conditional edges:} Represent branching decisions, such as in \<if-then-else> constructs. These edges are labeled, as seen in \Cref{tikz:condition}, where node \<C> branches to \<T> or \<F>.
\item \textbf{Loop edges:} Represent cycles in the graph, corresponding to loop constructs. For example, in \Cref{tikz:iteration}, the edge from \<B> back to \<C> represents a loop.
\item \textbf{Call edges:} Represent control transfers to other procedure graphs at call sites.
\end{itemize}
By constructing and composing such graphs, we can systematically generate large, structured programs with diverse control-flow behaviors.

% \subsection{Example}
% 
% For a simple code fragment:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
% if (x > 0) {
%     y = x + 1;
% } else {
%     y = x - 1;
% }
% return y;
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% The corresponding CFG would have:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item A node for the condition \texttt{x > 0}
%     \item A node for the true branch \texttt{y = x + 1}
%     \item A node for the false branch \texttt{y = x - 1}
%     \item A node for \texttt{return y}
%     \item Edges connecting these nodes according to the control flow
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Context-free grammar}

A context-free grammar consists of a set of definitions, where each definition corresponds to a \emph{nonterminal} symbol. Each definition contains multiple production rules that specify how the nonterminal can be constructed. The following
are the components of a context-free grammar.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nonterminal symbols}: Named syntactic variables that represent phrase structures in the language. In \Cref{fig:cfg}, symbols such as \nonterm{C} are nonterminals.
    \item \textbf{Terminal symbols}: The actual vocabulary of the language being defined. In \Cref{fig:cfg}, symbols such as \term{T} are terminals.
    \item \textbf{Definitions}: Each nonterminal symbol has a definition consisting of one or more alternative production rules. These alternatives represent the different ways the nonterminal can be constructed. In \Cref{fig:cfg}, 
    \mbox{\nonterm{Y} \expandsto \nonterm{C} \term{T} \nonterm{A} $|$ \nonterm{C} \term{F} \nonterm{B}}
    is a definition for \nonterm{Y} with two alternative production rules. 
    \item \textbf{Production rules}: Each rule specifies a possible form for the nonterminal on the left-hand side. A rule consists of a sequence of terminals and nonterminals that can replace the left-hand nonterminal in a derivation.
    In \Cref{fig:cfg}, 
    \mbox{\nonterm{Y} \expandsto \nonterm{C} \term{T} \nonterm{A}} is one of the production rules for \nonterm{Y}, the other being \mbox{\nonterm{Y} \expandsto \nonterm{C} \term{F} \nonterm{B}}.
\end{itemize}
\Cref{fig:bsearch3} is an example for a context-free grammar.

We next describe our proposed methodology for overcoming the limitations discussed in \Cref{sec:reachability}.
\subsection{Evaluating Estimators of \texorpdfstring{$S$}{S} Against Accurate Ground Truth}
To overcome the problem due to non-availability of complex programs with available
maximum coverage, we propose a novel methodology.

We note that any structured program can be translated into a simpler program
such that it contains only the following elements:
(1) sequence of statements
(2) if-then-else conditionals
(3) \<while> loops
(4) procedure calls.
Next, given such a simplified form and its control-flow,
we can leverage the following rules to convert the control-flow to the context-free grammar~(\Cref{fig:cfg}).
That is,
(1) for any conditional \<if C: A else: B>, translate to
  \mbox{\nonterm{IF} \expandsto \nonterm{C} \term{T} \nonterm{A}  $|$ \nonterm{C} \term{F} \nonterm{B}}
(2) for any given \<while C: B> loop, with a boolean conditional \<C>,
it can be translated to an equivalent grammar rule
%\begin{grammar}
\mbox{\nonterm{L} \expandsto \nonterm{C} \nonterm{B} \nonterm{L} $|$ \nonterm{C}}
%\end{grammar}
(3) procedure definitions such as \<def P(): B \ldots> translate to a nonterminal symbol with the same
name: \mbox{\nonterm{P} \expandsto \nonterm{B}}, and sequence of statements are simply captured
directly with corresponding tokens.
The details are given in \Cref{fig:cfg}.

Given that \emph{any structured program} can thus be translated into a
context-free grammar, the space of possible context-free grammars are also
the space of control-flows of possible programs. Hence, to evaluate how
an estimator performs on the reachability of all possible programs, it is
sufficient to generate a statistically significant number of complex
context-free programs that represent control-flows, and translate them back
to programs. This raises a question. How can we translate these control-flows
to equivalent programs with the same control flow.

Fortunately, there's a simple answer. Given any non-left-recursive context-free
grammar, we can generate a recursive-descent parser using these rules:
(1) Each nonterminal \nonterm{E} becomes a function \<def parse\_E>.
(2) Each production rule is implemented in that function.
(3) Lookahead tokens guide which rule to apply.
(4) Linear recursion can be replaced with a \<while> loop.
%Fortunately, there is an easy naswer. Given any non left-recursive context-free
%grammar, we can generate a recursive-descent parser by using the following rules:
%(1) Any nonterminal symbol in the grammar is turned into a procedure in the parser.
%(2) Each production rule is also turned into a procedure in the parser.
%(3) The particular rule to be used to parse is based on the \emph{lookahead}
%corresponding to each rule that matches the current symbol.
%(4) Any linear recursive nonterminal-rule combination is converted into a \texttt{while} loop.

Following in this fashion, we get a parser that directly corresponds to the context-free
grammar. For example, given the grammar 
\nonterm{E}\expandsto \nonterm{D} \nonterm{Es};
\nonterm{Es}\expandsto \term{+}\nonterm{D}\nonterm{Es}$|$ $\epsilon$, we can translate
this to:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python, escapechar=|,numbersep=2pt]
def parse_E():
  parse_D()

  while lookahead() == '+':
    consume('+')
    parse_D()
  return node

def parse_D():
  token = lookahead()
  if token and isdigit(token):
    consume(token)
  else:
    raise Error()
\end{lstlisting}
which has similar control-flow as a program from which such a grammar may have
been obtained.

While generating context-free grammars, we have several mechanisms to
precisely control the complexity. These include:
(1) The number of nonterminal symbols in the grammar
(2) The number of production rules
(3) The number of alphabets in the language
(4) The amount of direct and indirect recursion
(5) The length of individual rules
(6) The VC dimension of the language.
These parameters allow us to generate large scale parser programs at will with
complex control-flows. We can additionally increase the difficulty level by
adding extra constraints to the generated parser such
as context-sensitivity.

\noindent\textbf{Scalability and Applicability:} This methodology is designed to generate large-scale C parsers that consist of thousands of lines of code and complex control-flow.

\subsection{Assessing Reliability of \texorpdfstring{$\hat{S}$}{S-hat} Estimators Without Ground truth}
To overcome any limitation that may exist due to the synthetic nature of our
previously proposed benchmark, we propose a second criterion that can be applied
to real-world benchmarks without relying on availability of ground truth.

Our approach is inspired by the previous research on equivalent mutant
estimation~\cite{Kuznetsov2024empirical}, which suggests that varying
sample-units can be leveraged to evaluate the reliability of estimators.
The idea is that, while incidence-based statistical estimators of
fuzzing effectiveness may be sensitive to the sampling unit size ($r$),
a reliable estimator should produce overlapping point estimates for $S$â€”with
varying variance but consistent expectation when evaluated over equal-length
campaigns.

We propose to evaluate whether estimators of maximum reachability $S$ yield
consistent point estimates with overlapping confidence intervals, while allowing
for differences in estimation accuracy (i.e., variability) across fuzzing
campaigns with different sampling unit definitions $r$.


% TODO: This should be in the previous section. Not here.
% Prior empirical research on estimating maximum reachable coverage in fuzzing
% campaignsâ€”under the Bernoulli product modelâ€”has shown that statistical
% estimators systematically underestimate true reachability until near
% saturation, a phenomenon termed \emph{false peaks}~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}.
% This negative bias is largely inevitable in early stages due to the
% insufficiency of fuzzing data and the heterogeneous species diversity,
% which limits accurate approximation of the species distribution.
% 
% Prior research~\cite{liyanage2023reachable} empirically investigated this
% phenomenon, and suggests that estimators become reliable when the
% count of doubletons equals or exheeds singletons.

%  These limitations prompt a critical question: \emph{How can we ensure that statistical estimators provide reliable approximations of maximum reachability $S$ in fuzzing campaigns?}
% 
% \result{\textbf{Intuition:} While incidence-based statistical estimators of fuzzing effectiveness are sensitive to the sampling unit size ($r$), a reliable estimator should produce overlapping point estimates for $S$â€”with varying variance but consistent expectationâ€”when evaluated over equal-length campaigns.}
% 
% The incidence frequency countsâ€”particularly singletons ($f_1$) and doubletons ($f_2$)â€”are sensitive to the granularity of the sampling unit ($r$). Using individual inputs ($r=1$) yields the most fine-grained data, while aggregating inputs (e.g., over time intervals) reduces resolution. Aggregation tends to decrease $f_1$ and increase higher-frequency counts, as rare elements may co-occur within a unit. Since estimators like Chao2 depend directly on $f_1$ and $f_2$, the point estimate of species richness $\hat{S}$ may vary with changes in $r$, even under equal-length campaigns. Despite this sensitivity, the choice of $r$ is often arbitrary; for instance, \cite{liyanage2023reachable} adopts 15-minute intervals without justification.
% 
% However, since the maximum reachability $S$ is a finite quantity for any given fuzzing campaign, a reliable estimator should approximate it within reasonable error boundsâ€”despite variability in incidence frequencies introduced by changes in the sampling unit definitionâ€”provided that the estimation is performed at the same time point since the campaign's start. Leveraging this property, we evaluate whether estimators of maximum reachability $S$ yield consistent point estimates with overlapping confidence intervals, while allowing for differences in estimation accuracy (i.e., variability) across fuzzing campaigns with different sampling unit definitions $r$.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}
We describe the details our proposed experiment here.
\subsection{Research Questions}
How well do the current techniques for estimating the maximum reachability
of statements in a program perform? What are their limitations? Can the
point estimators be trusted? and are the confidence intervals obtained accurate?
The following research question will be investigating each of these points.

\noindent\textbf{RQ1:} How accurate are the estimators of maximum reachability
in terms of the point estimate as well as the confidence intervals?

The second question that we want to be answered is regarding the reliability
of the sampling units used in species richness based statistical estimators for
maximum reachability. We note that there are several methods for formulating
the problem of maximum reachability as a species richness estimate. For example,
if one is using traditional test cases, the sampling unit can be the test
classes and test methods as Kuznetsov et al.~\cite{Kuznetsov2024empirical}
demonstrates. On the other hand, in the case of fuzzing, where there is no
simple mechanism to identify non-overlapping sampling units, one can use the
incidence data under various time intervals as
Liyanage et al.~\cite{liyanage2021security} demonstrates. In both these cases, the
sampling units can be varied. In particular, Liyanage et al. chose 15~minutes
as the time interval for sampling unit. However, it can be asked if a time
interval of 5 minutes or even 60 minutes would have similar estimates.
The following research question will investigate this question.

\noindent\textbf{RQ2:} To what extent are the estimates of maximum reachability
$S$ sensitive to changes in the sampling unit size $r$?

\subsection{Fuzzers and Subject Programs}

For our experiments, we use AFL++ \cite{fioraldi2020AFL++}, a widely recognized state-of-the-art greybox fuzzer known for its performance and extensive adoption in recent research, particularly in reachability estimation studies. Using the same fuzzer as prior work enables direct and fair comparisons when evaluating estimator performance (RQ2).

We select a diverse set of real-world C programs from the FuzzBench platform \cite{metzman2021fuzzbench}, which provides a standardized fuzzing benchmarking environment. To ensure comparability with earlier studies (specifically for RQ2), we include all subject programs used in \cite{liyanage2023reachable}, along with several additional targets that are compatible with AFL++ and suitable for large-scale fuzzing.


\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Reachable program behaviors (e.g. code coverage and discovered bugs) determine the \emph{effectiveness} of a software testing process. For non-trivial programs, exhaustively exercising all possible behaviors is infeasible. Consequently, testing is often viewed as a means to demonstrate the presence of bugs, but not their absence~\cite{dijkstra2022reliability}. Despite this limitation, substantial effort has been directed toward increasing maximum reachability to enhance software security and reliability. Nevertheless, determining reachability remains a fundamental challenge in software testing. In fact, an efficient and precise determination of reachable code would effectively resolve the software verification problem~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}. 

Efforts to approximate reachability quantitatively have gained traction in the security domain, despite inherent difficulties. Empirical studies indicate that establishing the reachability of certain code regions is particularly challenging in large, complex code bases, using both static and dynamic analysis techniques~\cite{latoza2010developers}. Static analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, often suffer from over- or under-approximation when estimating reachable coverage~\cite{liyanage2023reachable,aniche2015why}. For instance, Nikoli\'{c} and Spoto~\cite{nikolic2013reachability} proposed approximating the reachability of program variables as a new abstract domain for static analysis. While their approach yields over-approximations, authors argue that it can be conservatively applied to identify unreachable code. Similarly, Mikol\'{a}\v{s} et al.~\cite{janota2007reachability} leveraged annotated code to define unreachability conditions and proposed an efficient algorithm for detecting unreachable code.

To assess reachability or unreachability in dynamic analysis, both constraint-solving techniques such as SMT\footnote{SMTâ€”Satisfiability Modulo Theory} and data-driven estimation methods have been explored. Naus et al.~\cite{naus2023low} proposed a technique for automatically generating preconditions to trigger specific post-conditions (e.g., bugs) using low-level code analysis. Similarly, Liew et al.~\cite{liew2019just} demonstrated how to encode SMT formulas within coverage-guided fuzzers to discover inputs that reach targeted program locations. In contrast, statistical approaches directly attempt to estimate the test effectiveness (aka maximum reachability) through observed behaviors. The pioneering STADS framework~\cite{boehme2018stads} introduced a suite of bio-statistical estimators by modeling fuzzing as a statistical sampling process. A recent evaluation of these estimators highlighted key challenges associated with reachability estimation~\cite{liyanage2023reachable}. When applied to estimate the number of killable mutants in mutation analysis, Kuznetsov et al.~\cite{Kuznetsov2024empirical} empirically demonstrated the unreliability of STADS estimators due to variations in sampling unit definitions. This finding, together with other recent studies, underscores the need for \emph{structure-aware} estimators that incorporate internal program structure, as opposed to structure-agnostic alternatives~\cite{lee2023statistical}.

Using synthetic benchmarks by program generation has been attempted before.
Fuzzle~\cite{lee2022fuzzle} is a benchmark for fuzzer evaluation that is built
by encoding a sequence of moves in a maze as a chain of function calls. The
limitation here is that mazes are rarely similar to real world programs.
They are limited by the moves one can make in a maze. Furthermore, solving
a maze typically requires finding a single path through a maze.
Recursive descent parsers, on the other hand, are real-world programs, and
are one of the major subjects in practical fuzzing.
Olympia~\cite{chadt2024olympia} based on Fuzzle generates \emph{solidity contracts} from generated mazes.

\section{Threats to Validity}\label{sec:threats}
%\todo{Need to fill this up.}

As with any empirical study, our findings on reachable coverage estimation in fuzzing are subject to potential threats to validity.

\emph{\textbf{Internal validity}} concerns the extent to which systematic errors are minimized. A key threat in our study is the establishment of a reliable ground truth for reachability, which is critical for the valid evaluation of estimator performance. Due to the limitations of existing methods for approximating ground truth in fuzzing, we use parsers derived from context-free grammars as benchmarks. These synthetic benchmarks provide exact ground truth reachability, enabling precise evaluation of estimation accuracy in terms of bias and variance. To further mitigate systematic bias from incorrect ground truth, we assess estimator reliability under varying sampling unit definitions within the same fuzzing campaign, without exposing the ground truth during estimation.

\emph{\textbf{External validity}} refers to the extent to which our findings generalize across fuzzers, seed corpora, and subject programs. The use of synthetic parser benchmarks does not compromise complexity, as such non-trivial parsers are widely accepted in fuzzing \cite{lee2022fuzzle} and reflect structural characteristics of real-world programs. We evaluate all estimators using AFL++~\cite{fioraldi2020AFL++}, which aligns with the underlying probabilistic model and represents a widely adopted, state-of-the-art fuzzer derived from the original AFL \cite{zalewski2017american}. Due to the nature of our subjects (i.e. parsers)â€”we lack well-established seed corpora. Instead, we use a well-formed single input as the initial seed for each subject and perform multiple fuzzing trials, reporting average performance to ensure robustness and generalization of our findings.

\emph{\textbf{Construct validity:}} Given our research objectives, in evaluating reachability estimator performance, it is critical that the chosen evaluation metrics reflect both accuracy and reliability. To ensure measurement validity, we adopt (1) mean bias and variance to assess estimator accuracy, and (2) sensitivity to varying sampling units to assess estimator reliability. These metrics are well-established in prior fuzzing and related statistical estimation research, thereby supporting the appropriateness and validity of our constructs.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this report, we propose to assess the reliability of species estimators when
they are used for estimating reachable coverage. We propose to do that both by
providing a synthetic benchmark with labeled ground truth, and also by
using a separate means of checking the reliability of estimators by varying
the sampling units used.
